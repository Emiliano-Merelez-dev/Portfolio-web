            React.js Course (Finished) - DevTalles
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            During my React training, I delved into the professional use of
            hooks to build modern, reusable and scalable applications. I learned
            to effectively integrate tools such as Context API, Redux and
            Firebase, and to develop custom hooks when the project required it.
            In addition, I incorporated good testing practices using Jest,
            ensuring code quality with unit tests applied to hooks, global
            states and connections to Firestore. The course approach prepared me
            to work with a complete stack such as MERN (MongoDB, Express, React,
            Node.js), which strengthened my ability to develop robust end-to-end
            solutions.

            Next.js Course (Finished) - DevTalles

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            I specialized in Next.js working with the new App Router, adopting
            the framework recommended by the official team. Throughout the
            course, I gained experience in both server-side and client-side
            components, managing complete flows with middlewares, error
            handling, dynamic layouts and optimized deployments. I learned how
            to implement authentication, authorization and data encryption,
            integrating technologies such as PostgreSQL, Prisma, Tailwind,
            Docker and more. The main focus was to take full advantage of
            techniques such as Server-Side Rendering, Incremental Static
            Regeneration and Server Actions, which allowed me to create robust,
            secure and scalable applications.

            Advanced JavaScript Course (Finished) - Udemy
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            I trained in JavaScript with a solid focus on the fundamentals of
            the most widely used language in modern web development. Through
            hands-on exercises and projects, I strengthened my programming logic
            and mastered key concepts such as data types, operators, control
            structures, arrays and objects. I thoroughly explored functions, the
            prototyping model and inheritance, as well as modern classes in ES6.
            In addition, I worked with DOM manipulation and specialized in
            asynchrony management through AJAX, Promises and API consumption,
            preparing me to face real challenges in frontend development.
